# Wellness & Reminder Bot

**Video demo:** https://youtu.be/PwdqjsL4Bq8  

This is my **CS50P Final Project**.  
It’s a simple Telegram bot that helps users take care of themselves during long study or work sessions.  
The bot sends reminders to drink water, stretch, and take breaks.  
Users can set their own reminder intervals by editing a small config file.
